# File Sum Project 
# Introduction

this is a simple C program that reads two input files containing lists of integers, computes the element-wise sums of corresponding integers, and writes the results to an output file.
It can also compare the generated output against a reference file to verify correctness.

This tool is useful for testing integer addition, file I/O handling, and validation logic in C.
# Installation

Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., gcc).

Compile the program:

gcc main.c -o file_sum


Ensure all text files (file_1.txt, file_2.txt, file_3.txt) are in the same directory.

The program works if file_3.txt and file_output.txt are the same
